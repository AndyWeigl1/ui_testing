### New Enhancement Ideas üí°
Based on the completed history feature, consider these additions:

## Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

* **SOP Buttons on Scripts Page:**
    * Reintroduce SOP buttons to each script card on the Scripts page.
    * Link these buttons to the corresponding SOPs, similar to how the SOPs page functions.
* **SOP Page Card Sizing:**
    * Address the left-alignment issue of data within SOP cards, which causes visual distortions when the window size increases.
    * Improve the layout when filtering results in a single card, preventing excessive empty space on the right. Implement a new system for better visual presentation.
* **Legacy Header Container:**
    * Re-evaluate the container holding "Script Control Panel" text, the dark/light mode toggle, and the status indicator.
    * **Proposal 1:** Move the status indicator to the navbar (left of the first button, right of the logo). Remove the rest of the container as the dark mode toggle is redundant (already in settings).
    * **Consider:** Explore alternative solutions for a cleaner and more modern UI.
